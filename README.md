# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Purpose of the Analysis
The Pewlet-Hackard corporation requested information about their employee base with particular interest in those employees who are nearing retirement age. This analysis also included determination of employees who may be mentors to more junior employees.

## Results
The data analysis done for the Pewlett-Hackard corporation used SQL to build queries on the nearly 500,000 employee records which was contained in six different databases. Data modeling allowed intelligent combining of these databases to provide the following conclusions:
- Pewlett-Hackard provided 499,998 employee records to analyze. 
- Of these nearly 500,000 employees, around 10% (52,158 employees) of them are nearing retirement age. 
- The distribution of titles of these employees nearing retirement age are shown below:
!(

- Mentorship could be a way to prepare the next generation of employees as there are nearly 72,000 employees eligible to be mentors.

## Summary
Pewlett-Hackard is facing the replacement of nearly 10% of its workforce as employees near retirement age, or what is called the "silver tsunami". There will be 52,158 vacated positions based on the age of current employees. 

Good succession planning means that each department will need to determine how mentorship relationships are established. For instance, in the Engineering department, there are nearly 14,000 Engineers and Senior Engineers who can become mentors to Assitant Enginners or those that have recently joined the company. 

The department that may be in the most need for qualified mentors are Managers. This analysis shows that there are two employees that are nearing retirement age, which is not nearly enough to mentor current Managers. 

Additional data analysis would be helpful to delineate further the types of roles and departments in the "Senior Staff" title group. With nearly 25,000 employees, there may be plenty of opportunities for mentoring once the departments for these Senior Staff is known. Finally, the data anlysis of the number of generically named "Staff" employees would provide further insight into possible mentorship or early retirement opportunties for that employee group.
